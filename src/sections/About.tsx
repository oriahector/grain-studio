   <strong>Grain Studio</strong> is a creative practice rooted in web development, shaped by design, brand strategy, and photography. Our work lives where technology meets aesthetics — translating ideas into fast, intentional, and beautifully structured digital experiences. We build websites and visual systems that move with rhythm and precision, merging strategy and craft to create brands that feel alive on screen. Every project is approached with a developer’s logic and a designer’s eye, balancing clarity, performance, and emotion.

            Behind Grain Studio are <a className="underline" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hmartinezoria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Héctor</a> and <a className="underline" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clara-morrondo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clara</a>, two creatives who share a belief that design and code should coexist seamlessly. Together, we craft digital ecosystems that are thoughtful, fast, and culturally aware — from concept to launch. Whether defining a new identity or building a web experience from the ground up, we focus on what matters most: precision in development, meaning in design, and care in every detail.
